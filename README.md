# RMSpellChecker

## Synopsis

RMSpellChecker is an Objective-C command line interface designed to run in a Unix environment that captures user input from the command line, checks the spelling (case errors, repeated letters, and vowels) against a dictionary (from the list of words in /usr/share/dict/words) in memory, and returns a correctly spelled suggestion if possible.

## Compile and Run

This program was developed with MacOS Sierra version 10.12.4, Xcode version 8.3.2, and Objective-C 2.0.

First navigate to the RMSpellChecker folder inside the RMSpellChecker project.
